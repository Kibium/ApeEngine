WELCOME TO THE APE ENGINE PAGE!

Here, I, Toni Ferrari, am creating a game engine from scratch with C++.

The libraries I used to make this project possible are:
* ImGui, so I have an awesome GUI
* SDL / SDL_image, so i handle input and handle some image stuff
* MathGeoLib, that allows to use matrixs and vectors, which are useful in 3D programming
* DevIL, so i load images smoothly 
* GLEW, for handeling OpenGL stuff
* Assimp, in order to load 3D models
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ENGINE FEATURES
* 3D Unity-like camera
* Real time 3D model loading by drag and drop to the frame
* Real time texture loading to the actual model loaded
* An ImGui window that allows to play with the renderer and several parameters
